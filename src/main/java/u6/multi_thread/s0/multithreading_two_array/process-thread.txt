True parallel can work only on at least 2 core.

Objects and classes have the Monitor. The Monitor is an abstraction for synchronizing. Synchronized doesn't mean "simultaneously executing". It means "synchronized access to code - only one thread can process this code.

At first, MyRunnable looks more logical than SomeClassName. But for real - many classes implements many interfaces. And their names isn't correspond with interface's names. The implementation of interface endows attributes to a type(class). Instead "MyRunnable" you can use "ArrayHandler".

Runnable
    run()
Thread implements Runnable
    Runnable target
    Thread(Runnable)
    start()
        //magic of create kernel thread...
        run()
    run()
        if (target != null) target.run()
